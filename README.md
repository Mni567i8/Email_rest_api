ðŸ“§ Email Sending Project
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Email Sending project. This is a simple web application I built as part of my learning journey. It allows users to send emails using a cool form and a bit of magic behind the scenes. No SendGrid needed!

Features
Contact Form: A sleek and user-friendly contact form where you can spill your thoughts. Fields include name, email, and a message.

Email Sending: Behind the scenes, there's a bit of JavaScript magic to handle the email sending using a REST API.

Responsiveness: Your form will look awesome on any device. Small screens, big screens, you name it!

Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the webpage.

CSS: Styling to make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: Adds some life to the form with client-side validation and handling the REST API.

Project Files
index.html: This is where the web form lives. Go ahead, take a peek!

style.css: Adds some flair to the form. Make it look snazzy!

script.js: The JavaScript file makes sure everything runs smoothly. No bugs allowed!
